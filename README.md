Viewer for Ruby Warrior
----------------------

This is a tiny [Green Shoes](https://github.com/ashbb/green_shoes) app. 
It shows your [Ruby Warrior](https://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior) log a little bit visually. 

It has two modes, `auto` and `step by step`, which will be switched by a mouse click. 
In step by step mode, you can use `Up` arrow key and `Down` arrow key. 
Watch [this](http://www.rin-shun.com/shoes/rwviewer.swf.html).
